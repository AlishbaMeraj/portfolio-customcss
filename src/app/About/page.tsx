              I am an experienced Frontend Developer, currently expanding my expertise by learning Next.js for both backend
              and frontend development. My journey in tech was significantly shaped by completing a TypeScript course at the
              Governor Sindh IT Initiative (GIAIC). It was here that I also embarked on learning Cloud Applied Generative AI
              Engineering with cutting-edge technologies. Additionally, I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Business
              Administration (BBA), where I gain insights into the business industry.
